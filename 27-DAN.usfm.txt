\s1 Nebuchadnezzar had a gold statue made 
\p
\v 1 King Nebuchadnezzar ordered his men to make a gold statue. It was ◄90 feet/27 meters► high and ◄9 feet/2.7 meters► wide.
They set it up in the Dura plain in Babylon province. 
\v 2 Then he sent messages to all the provincial governors, the district governors, the chief advisors, the counselors, the
various judges, and all the other officials in the province. He told them to come to the dedication of the statue that he had
set up. 
\v 3 When they all arrived, and they were all standing in front of that statue,
\p
\v 4 an announcer shouted, “You people who come from many countries and many people-groups and who speak many languages, listen
to what the king has commanded! 
\v 5 When you hear the sounds made by the trumpets, the flutes, the guitars, the harps, the wind instruments, and all the other
musical instruments, bow down to worship King Nebuchadnezzar's gold statue.
\v 6 Anyone who refuses to do that will be thrown into a blazing furnace!”
\p
\v 7 So when all those people who had gathered heard the sounds made by the musical instruments, they all bowed down to worship
the statue. 
\b
\p
\v 8 But some of the men who studied the stars went to the king.
\v 9 They reported to him, “We hope that you, O king, will live a long time!
\v 10 You decreed that all the officials \add whom you had gathered\add* should bow down and worship the gold statue when they
heard the sounds made by the musical instruments. 
\v 11 You also decreed that those who refused to do that would be thrown into a blazing furnace.
\v 12 Sir, there are some men from Judah whom you have appointed to be officials in Babylon province who have not obeyed your
decree. Their names are Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. They have refused to worship your god and the gold statue that you
have set up.” 
\p
\v 13 Nebuchadnezzar became very angry. He commanded \add his soldiers\add* to bring in Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. When
they were brought to him, 
\v 14 Nebuchadnezzar said to them, “Is it true that you three men have refused to worship my gods or the gold statue that I
have set up? 
\v 15  \add If that is true\add*, I will give you one more chance. If you bow down to worship the statue that I have set up
when you hear the sounds of the musical instruments, fine. But if you refuse, you will be thrown immediately into the blazing
furnace. Then ◄what god will be able to rescue you from my power?/no god will be able to rescue you from my power!►” [RHQ]
\p
\v 16 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied, “Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend our
\add actions\add* to you in this matter. 
\v 17 If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God whom we worship is able to rescue us. Sir, he will rescue us from your
power. 
\v 18 But even if he does not rescue us, you need to know that we will never worship your gods or the gold statue that you have
set up.” 
\p
\v 19 Nebuchadnezzar was extremely angry. His being very angry even showed on his face. He commanded that the furnace should be
made seven times as hot as usual. 
\v 20  \add After that was done\add*, he commanded some of the very strong men of his army to tie Shadrach, Meshach and
Abednego, and then to throw them into the blazing furnace. 
\v 21 So the soldiers tied them up and threw them into the furnace, while they were wearing their clothes.
\v 22 Because the fire had been made very hot because the king had very strongly ordered them to do that, the flames leaped out
and killed the soldiers as they were throwing the men into the fire!
\v 23 So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego fell into the roaring flames.
\p
\v 24 But as Nebuchadnezzar was watching, he was amazed. He suddenly jumped up and shouted to his advisors, “Did we tie up
three men and throw them into the flames, or not?” 
\p They replied, “Yes, O king, we did.” 
\p
\v 25 Nebuchadnezzar shouted, “Look! I see four men in the fire! They have no ropes on them, they are walking around, and the
flames are not hurting them! And the fourth man looks like a divine being!”
\p
\v 26 Nebuchadnezzar came closer to the opening of the flaming furnace, and he shouted, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, you
who worship the Supreme God, come out of there! Come here!” So they stepped out of the fire.
\p
\v 27 Then all the king's officials crowded around them. They saw that the flames had not harmed them. The flames had not even
singed any of the hair on their heads or scorched any of their clothes! There was not even any smell of smoke on them!
\p
\v 28 Then Nebuchadnezzar said, “Praise the God whom Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
\add worship\add*! He sent one of his angels to rescue these three men who worship him and trust in him. They ignored my
command; they insisted that they would worship only their God, and were willing to die instead of worshiping any other god.
\v 29 Therefore, I am now making this decree: ‘If any people, from any country or people-group or any language group, criticize
the God whom Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego worship, they will be cut in pieces and their houses will be torn down and made
into a pile of rubble. There is no other god who can rescue people like this!’”
\p
\v 30 Then the king gave Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego more important positions in Babylon province than they had before.\c 4  
\s1 Nebuchadnezzar dreamed about a tree 
\p
\v 1  \add Several years after\add* Nebuchadnezzar \add started to
rule\add*, he sent this message to the people of every nation and people-group and all language groups in his empire. He wrote,
\b
\pi1 “I wish/hope that all things go very well with you! 
\b
\pi1
\v 2 I want you to know about all the wonderful miracles [DOU] that the Supreme God has performed for me.
\b
\q1
\v 3 He performs great miracles, 
\q2 and does wonderful things. 
\q1 His kingdom will last forever; 
\q2 his rule \add over people\add* will never end. 
\b
\pi1
\v 4 I, Nebuchadnezzar, was living in my palace. I was living luxuriantly, and everything was going very well for me.
\v 5 But one night I had a dream that caused me to be very afraid. I saw visions that terrified me as I lay on my bed.
\v 6 So I summoned all the wise men in Babylon, in order that they would come and tell me what it meant.
\v 7 All the men who worked magic, the fortune-tellers, the men who worked sorcery, and men who studied the stars came to me. I
told them what I had dreamed, but they could not tell me what it meant.
\v 8 Finally, Daniel came to me, and I \add decided to\add* tell him what I had dreamed. One of my officials had given him a
new name, Belteshazzar, to honor my own god. I knew that the spirit of the holy gods was in him.
\pi1
\v 9 So, \add using the name that had been given to him\add*, I said, ‘Belteshazzar, you are the most important of all my
fortune-tellers. I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and that you can reveal all mysteries. There is none that
is too difficult for you. So, tell me what my dream means. 
\v 10 This is what I dreamed while I was lying on my bed: I saw a large tree
\add growing\add* in the middle of the land. 
\v 11 The tree was very strong and had grown very tall; \add it seemed
that\add* its top reached up to the sky, with the result that everyone in the world [HYP] could see it.
\v 12 It had beautiful leaves, and it had produced a lot of fruit for people to eat. Wild animals rested in the shade of that
tree, and birds built nests in its branches. All the living creatures everywhere in the world got food from that tree.
\pi1
\v 13 While I was still lying on my bed, I saw a vision. In the vision I saw a holy angel coming down from heaven.
\v 14 The angel shouted, “Cut down the tree, and cut off its branches. Strip/Shake off all of its leaves, and scatter its
fruit. Chase away the animals that are lying in the shade of the tree, and the birds that are in its branches.
\v 15 But leave the stump of the tree and its roots in the ground. Fasten a band of iron and bronze around the stump, and allow
it to stay there with grass around it.” 
\pi1
\v 16  \add That tree seems to have represented a man, because the angel also
said\add*, “Cause that man to live \add out in the fields\add* among the animals and plants. Cause the dew from the sky to make
his body damp \add each morning\add*. Do not allow him to \add continue
to\add* have a mind like humans; instead, cause him to have a mind like animals have, for seven years.
\pi1
\v 17 The holy angels have decided what must happen. They want to inform everyone that the Supreme God rules over all the
kingdoms in this world. He is the one who chooses who will rule these kingdoms. He
\add sometimes\add* allows very unimportant people to become rulers.”
\pi1
\v 18 Belteshazzar, that is what I, King Nebuchadnezzar, saw in my dream. Now tell me what the dream means. No one else can
tell me. \add I asked\add* all the very wise men in my kingdom to tell me what It means, but they were unable to do that. But
you can tell me, because the spirit of the holy gods is in you.’ ”
\s1 Daniel explained the dream 
\pi1
\v 19 I, whose new name was Belteshazzar, did not say anything for some time, because I was very worried/disturbed about the
meaning of the dream. Finally, the king said to me, “Belteshazzar, do not be afraid about the dream and about what it means.” I
replied, “Sir, I wish that the events that were predicted in your dream would happen to your enemies, and not to you.
\pi1
\v 20  \add In your dream/vision\add* you saw a very strong and very tall tree. It seemed to reach to the sky, with the result
that everyone in the world could see it. 
\v 21 It had beautiful leaves and it had produced a lot of fruit for people to eat. Wild animals rested in the shade of that
tree, and birds built nests in its branches. 
\v 22 ◄Your majesty/O King►, that tree \add represents\add* you! You have become very powerful.
\add It is as though\add* your greatness reaches up to the sky, and you rule people all over the world.
\pi1
\v 23 Then you saw a holy angel coming down from heaven. That angel said, ‘Cut down the tree, and cut off its branches.
Strip/Shake off all of its leaves, and scatter its fruit. But leave the stump of the tree and its roots in the ground. Fasten a
band of iron and bronze around the stump and allow it to stay there with grass around it.
\add Each morning\add* cause the dew from the sky to make this man,
\add who was represented by the tree\add*, damp. Cause him to live in the fields with the animals for seven years.’
\pi1
\v 24 ◄Your Majesty/O King►, this is what your dream means. This is what the Supreme God has declared will happen to you.
\v 25  \add Your advisors\add* will force you to live away from other people. You will live in the fields with the wild
animals. You will eat grass like cows do, and dew from the sky will cause your body to be damp/wet
\add every morning\add*. You will live that way for seven years, until you learn that it is the Supreme God who rules over the
kingdoms of the world, and he appoints the ones whom he chooses \add to rule
them\add*. 
\v 26 But the stump of the tree and its roots were left in the ground. That means that you will rule your kingdom again when
you learn that it is God [MTY] who is really the ruler. 
\v 27 ◄Your Majesty/O King►, please do what I am telling you to do. Stop sinning, and do what is right. Turn away from your
evil behavior. Act mercifully to poor people. If you do that, perhaps you will continue to be sucessful.”
\s1 The dream was fulfilled 
\pi1
\v 28 But \add the king refused to do\add* these things. So they did happen to him.
\v 29 Twelve months later, \add one day\add* he was walking \add on the flat
roof\add* of his palace in Babylon. 
\v 30 As he looked out over/across the city, he said \add to those around
him\add*, “I have built this great city of Babylon to be the place where I rule! I have built it with my own power, in order
\add to show people\add* my glory, to show them that I am very great!”
\pi1
\v 31 While he was still saying this, God [MTY] spoke from heaven and said, “King Nebuchadnezzar, this is what I am saying must
happen: You are no longer the ruler of this kingdom! 
\v 32 Your advisors will force you to live away from other people. You will live in the fields with wild animals, and you will
eat grass like cows do. You will live that way for seven years, until you learn that it is I, the Supreme God, who rules over
the kingdoms of this world, and I appoint the ones whom I have chosen to rule them.”
\pi1
\v 33 Immediately what God predicted happened. Nebuchadnezzar \add could not think like normal people
think\add*, and his advisors forced him to live away from other people. He ate grass like cows do, and dew from the sky caused
his body to be damp/wet \add every morning\add*. He lived like that until his hair was as long as eagles' feathers, and his
fingernails became like birds' claws. 
\b
\pi1
\v 34 After those seven years ended, I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked up toward heaven,
\add and I acknowledged that what God said was true\add*. Then I could think correctly again. I praised and worshiped the
Supreme God, and I honored him, the one who lives forever. 
\b
\q1 He rules forever; 
\q2 his kingdom will never end. 
\q1
\v 35 All the people in the world are very insignificant; 
\q2 we are not like him. 
\q1 He has the power to do whatever he wants to do, 
\q2 among the angels in heaven and among us people who live on the earth.
\q1 So no one can stop him [SYN], 
\q2 and no one can challenge him, 
\q2 saying to him, “Why \add are you doing these things\add*?” 
\b
\pi1
\v 36 When I was able to think correctly again, I was honored again, and I was able to rule my glorious/great kingdom again. My
advisors came to me again \add to talk about what should be done\add*, and I became greater and more powerful than I was
before. 
\v 37 Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and honor [DOU] God, the king who rules in heaven. All of his actions are just and right.
And he is able to cause to become humble those who are proud, \add like I
was\add*. \c 5  
\s1 The writing on the wall 
\p
\v 1  \add Several years later\add*, Belshazzar \add became the king of Babylon. One
day\add* he invited a thousand of his officers to a big feast, and he drank
\add a lot of\add* wine with them. 
\v 2 While he was drinking, he commanded that his servants bring to him the gold and silver cups that the previous king,
Nebuchadnezzar, had taken from the temple in Jerusalem. He did that because he wanted himself and his officials, his wives, and
even his ◄concubines/slave wives► to drink from them, \add making fun of the god that the Israelis
worshiped\add*. 
\v 3 So his servants brought in all those gold cups, that had been taken
\add many years previously\add* from the temple of \add the true\add* God in Jerusalem. Then the king and his officials and his
wives and his slave wives drank \add wine\add* from those cups. 
\v 4 They drank to praise/honor their idols that were made of gold, silver, bronze, iron, and
\add even\add* wood and stone. 
\p
\v 5 Suddenly they saw a man's handwriting on the plaster of the wall opposite the lampstand. The king also saw the hand as it
was writing. 
\v 6 He became very frightened, and his face became pale/white. His knees started shaking, and his legs became very weak, with
the result that he could not stand up. 
\p
\v 7 Then he shouted to summon the men who worked magic, the men who studied the stars, and the fortune-tellers. He said, “I
will \add greatly honor\add* any one of them who can read this writing and tell me what it means. I will give him a purple
\add robe like I wear because I am the king\add*, and I will put a gold chain around his neck. He will become a very important
official in my kingdom; there will be only two others who will be more important than he will be.”
\p
\v 8 But when all those wise men came in, none of them could read the writing, or tell him what it meant.
\v 9 So King Belshazzar became more afraid. His face became even paler/whiter. And all his officials
\add who were there at the feast\add* did not know what to do. 
\p
\v 10 But when the mother of the king (OR, of the previous king) heard the king and his officials talking loudly
\add about what had happened\add*, she entered the room where they were having the feast. She said
\add to Belshazzar\add*, “◄Your majesty/O King►, I hope you will live for a long time! But do not be pale and afraid about
this. 
\v 11 There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods in him. When Nebuchadnezzar was ruling, they
discovered that this man understood many things and was wise, just like the gods. The man who was king previously,
Nebuchadnezzar, appointed him to be in charge of all the men in Babylon who worked magic, the men who worked sorcery, the men
who studied the stars, and the fortune-tellers. 
\v 12 That man's name is Daniel; the king gave him a new name, Belteshazzar. He is very intelligent and is able to know and
understand many things. He even is able tell the meaning of dreams, and explain riddles, and explain things that are very
difficult to understand. Summon him, and he will tell you what \add this
writing\add* means.” 
\s1 Daniel interpreted the writing 
\p
\v 13 So they went and brought me in. The king asked me, “You must be Daniel [RHQ]! They told me that you are one of those who
was brought here from Judah by the previous king. 
\v 14 I have also heard that the spirit of the gods is in you, and that you are very wise and understand many things.
\v 15 My wise men and men who work magic have tried to read the writing on this wall and tell me what it means, but are not
able to do it. 
\v 16 Someone told me that you can tell what dreams mean and explain things that are very difficult to understand. If you can
read these words and tell me what they mean, I will give you a purple
\add robe like I wear because I am the king\add*, and I will put a gold chain around your neck. You will become a very
important official in my kingdom; there will be only two others who will be more important than you will be.”
\p
\v 17 I replied and said to the king, “\add I do not want\add* your gifts; keep them, or give them to someone else. But I will
read for you the writing on the wall, and I will tell you what it means.
\p
\v 18 ◄Your Majesty/O king►, the Supreme God caused the man who was king before you, Nebuchadnezzar, to become a great ruler,
who was greatly praised and honored. 
\v 19 Because God caused him to become very great, people of many [HYP] people-groups and nations and who spoke many different
languages were very much afraid of him. He commanded \add his soldiers\add* to kill those whom he wanted to be killed, and he
◄spared/allowed to live► those whom he wanted to spare. He honored those whom he wanted to honor, and he caused to be disgraced
those whom he wanted to be disgraced. 
\v 20 But when he became very proud and stubborn [IDI], he was removed from being king [MTY]. People did not consider him to be
glorious/great anymore. 
\v 21  \add His officials\add* sent him away in order that he would not be near other people.
\add God\add* caused him to have a mind like animals have. He lived among the wild donkeys. He ate grass like cows do, and dew
from the sky caused his body to be damp/wet \add each morning\add*.
\add He was like that\add* until he learned that the Supreme God is really the one who rules the kingdoms of this world, and
that he appoints whoever he chooses to rule those kingdoms. 
\p
\v 22 Now, Belshazzar, you have become the king. You also knew all these things, but you have not made yourself humble.
\v 23 You have considered yourself to be greater than \add God\add*, the Lord of heaven. So you have commanded your servants to
bring to you these sacred cups, \add which were dedicated to the Supreme
God\add*, and which were taken from his temple \add in Jerusalem\add*. You and your officials and your wives and your
◄concubines/slave wives► have been drinking wine from these cups, while you have been praising your own gods—gods which are
made of gold and silver and bronze and iron and wood and stone. Those are gods that cannot see, that cannot hear, and that do
not know anything! You have not honored the God who gives you breath and who controls everything that happens to you.
\v 24 So God sent this hand to write a message \add for you\add*.
\p
\v 25 This is the message that it wrote: ‘\sc Mene, mene, tekel,
parsin.\sc*’ 
\p
\v 26 This is what those words mean: 
\li1 \sc Mene\sc* means 'numbered/counted.' That means that God has been counting the days that you will rule, and he has now
decided that you will not rule anymore. 
\li1
\v 27  \sc Tekel\sc* means 'weighed.' \add It is as though God\add* has weighed you on a scale, and you do not weigh what you
should, \add which means that you have not been doing what you should; you are not fit to be a
king\add* [MET]. 
\li1
\v 28  \sc Parsin\sc* means 'divided.' That means that \add God\add* has divided your kingdom. Some of it will be ruled by
people from Media and some will be ruled by people from Persia.”
\p
\v 29 Then Belshazzar \add did what he had promised\add*. He put on me a purple robe like the one he himself wore. He put a
gold chain around my neck. And he proclaimed that there would be only two others who would be more important than me
\add in this kingdom\add*. 
\p
\v 30 But that same night \add soldiers from Media entered the city
and\add* killed Belshazzar, the king of Babylonia. 
\v 31 Darius, the king of Media, became the king \add of Babylonia\add* when he was sixty-two years old.\c 6  
\s1 Daniel was thrown into the lions' den 
\p
\v 1 King Darius decided to divide his kingdom into 120 provinces. He appointed a governor to rule each province.
\v 2 He also appointed me and two other men to be administrators, to supervise the governors and to be sure that they did the
king's work \add properly\add*, in order that the king would not have to worry.
\v 3 I soon showed that I was ◄more capable/able to do the work better► than all the other administrators and the governors.
Because of that, the king planned to appoint me to be in charge of the entire empire.
\v 4 Then, the other administrators and the governors \add became
jealous\add*. So they began to search to find something that they could criticize about the way I was working for the king. But
I always did my work faithfully and honestly, and was never lazy. So they could not find anything to criticize.
\v 5 They concluded, “The only way we can find something for which we can criticize Daniel will be something concerning the
laws that his god \add his given him\add*.” 
\p
\v 6 So the administrators and governors went as one group to the king and said, “◄Your Majesty/O king►, we wish that you will
live a long time! 
\v 7 We administrators and governors and district governors and advisors and other officials have all agreed that you should
make a law that everyone must obey. We want you to command that for the next thirty days people may pray only to you. If anyone
prays to anyone else, either to a human or to a god, he must be thrown into
\add a pit of\add* lions. 
\v 8 And because laws made by \add our governments of\add* Media and Persia cannot be changed,
\add we want\add* you, \add the head of our government\add*, to sign it.”
\v 9 So King Darius \add wrote\add* the law and signed it. 
\p
\v 10 But when I found out that \add the king\add* had written \add and
signed\add* that law, I went home. I knelt down in my upstairs room and prayed. I looked toward Jerusalem, and the windows were
open \add with the result that everyone could see me while I was
praying\add*. I prayed three times each day, just as I always did, thanking God.
\v 11 The officials went together \add to my house\add* and they saw me praying and requesting God to help me.
\v 12 So they returned to the king and said to him, “\add Do you
remember\add* that you wrote a law stating that for the next thirty days people may pray only to you, and if anyone prays to
anyone else, either to a human or to a god, he will be thrown into
\add a pit of\add* lions?” 
\p The king replied, “Yes, that is \add the law that I wrote\add*. It is a law of
\add our governments of\add* Media and Persia, which cannot be canceled.”
\p
\v 13 Then they said to the king, “That \add man\add* Daniel, one of the men who were brought from Judah, is not paying any
attention to you or the law that you \add signed\add*. He prays to his god three times each day!”
\v 14 When the king heard that, he was very distressed. He tried to find a way to save me. All the rest of the day he tried to
think of a way to rescue me. 
\p
\v 15  \add In the evening, many of\add* [HYP] the officials went together to the king and said, “◄Your Majesty/O king►, you
know that \add our governments of\add* Media and Persia have declared that no law that the king signs can be canceled/changed.
\add So Daniel must be thrown to the lions!\add*” 
\p
\v 16 So the king gave the order, and his servants brought me and threw me into a pit where the lions
\add were\add*. \add Before they threw me in\add*, the king said to me, “I hope/wish that your God, whom you worship regularly,
will rescue you!” 
\p
\v 17 They rolled a huge stone across the entrance to the pit. Then the king
\add fastened a string across the entrance and put wax at each end, and stamped the wax
with\add* the seal from his \add ring\add* and the seals \add of the
rings\add* of his officials, in order that no one could \add secretly\add* rescue me.
\v 18 Then the king returned to his palace. That night he refused to eat any food. He would not allow anyone to entertain him
\add because he did not want to be happy, with the result that he would forget about
me\add*. And that night he was unable to sleep \add because he was worried about
me\add*. 
\p
\v 19 At dawn the next morning, the king got up and went quickly to the pit where the lions were.
\v 20 When he came near it, he was very worried. He called out, “Daniel, you who serve the all-powerful God! Was your God, whom
you worship regularly, able to save you from the lions?” 
\p
\v 21 I answered, “◄Your Majesty/O king►, I hope that you will live a long time!
\v 22 Yes, my God sent his angel to shut the lions' mouths, in order that they would not harm me! He did that because
\add he knows that\add* I have done nothing that he thinks is wrong. And, ◄Your Majesty/O king►, I never did anything wrong to
you!” 
\p
\v 23 The king was extremely happy, and he commanded his servants to lift me out of the pit. When they did that, they saw that
the lions had not wounded me at all. \add God had protected me\add* because I trusted in him.
\p
\v 24 Then the king commanded that the men who had accused me should be seized and be thrown, along with their wives and
children, into the pit where the lions were. When they were thrown into the pit, the lions leaped on them and crushed their
bones before they fell onto the bottom of the pit! 
\p
\v 25 Then King Darius \add wrote\add* this message and sent it throughout his kingdom to the people of every people-group and
nation and from all language groups: 
\b
\pi1 “I wish/hope that all things go very well with you! 
\pi1
\v 26 I command that everyone in my kingdom should fear and revere the God that Daniel
\add worships\add*. 
\q1 He is the all-powerful God, 
\q2 and he will live forever. 
\q1 His kingdom will never be destroyed; 
\q2 he will rule forever. 
\q1
\v 27 He rescues and saves \add his people\add*. 
\q2 He performs all kinds of miracles 
\q2 in heaven and on the earth. 
\q1 He rescued Daniel from the power of the lions!” 
\p
\v 28 So I was successful all during the time that Darius ruled and during the time that Cyrus, the king of Persia, ruled.\c 7  
\s1 Daniel dreamed about four beasts 
\p
\v 1  \add Previously\add*, during the first year that Belshazzar was the king of Babylonia, I had a dream and a vision one
night as I lay on my bed. \add The next morning\add* I wrote down what I had dreamed. This is what I wrote:
\p
\v 2 I, Daniel, had a vision during the night. In the vision I saw that strong winds were blowing from all four directions,
stirring up \add the water in\add* the ocean. 
\v 3 Then \add I saw\add* four beasts coming out of the ocean. All four of them were different.
\p
\v 4 The first one resembled a lion, but it had wings like an eagle has. But as I watched, something tore off its wings {its
wings were pulled off}. The beast was left there, standing on its two hind/rear legs, like a human being stands. And it was
given a mind like humans have. 
\p
\v 5 The second beast resembled a bear. It was crouching, and it held between its teeth three ribs
\add from another animal that it had killed and eaten\add*. Someone said to it {It was told}, “Stand up and eat as much meat as
you want!” 
\p
\v 6 Then I saw in front of me the third of these beasts. It resembled a leopard, but it had four wings protruding from its
back. The wings were like a bird's wings. It had four heads. It was given the power/authority to rule
\add people\add*. 
\p
\v 7 In the vision I saw a fourth beast. It was stronger than the other beasts, and it was more terrifying. It crushed other
creatures with its huge iron teeth and ate their flesh. The parts of animals that it did not grind with its teeth, it trampled
\add on the ground\add*. It was different from the other three beasts: It had ten horns
\add on its head\add*. 
\p
\v 8 While I was looking at those horns, I saw a little horn appear
\add on the head of that beast\add*. It tore out three of the other horns. This little horn had eyes like humans have, and it
had a mouth \add with which it spoke\add* very boastfully. 
\p
\v 9 Then while I watched, 
\q1 thrones were put in the places \add where they belonged\add*,
\q2 and \add God\add*, the one who had been living forever, sat on one of the thrones.
\q1 His clothes were as white as snow, 
\q2 and his hair was as white as pure/clean wool. 
\q1 His throne had wheels that were blazing with fire, 
\q2 and his throne was also blazing. 
\q1
\v 10 A fire was rushing out of in front of him like a stream. 
\q1 Many thousands \add of people\add* (OR, \add angels\add*) were there serving him,
\q2 and millions \add of other people\add* (OR, \add angels\add*) were standing in front of him.
\q1 They started ◄the court session/judging people►, 
\q2 and they opened the books \add in which they had written the record of all the good and bad things that people had
done\add*. 
\p
\v 11 While I was watching, I could hear the little horn speaking very boastfully. As I continued to watch, the fourth beast
was killed. Its corpse was thrown into a fire and completely burned.
\v 12 The power/authority of the other three beasts was taken away from them, but they were allowed to continue to live for a
while. 
\p
\v 13 While I \add continued to\add* see the vision that night, I saw someone who resembled a human being. He was coming
\add closer to me\add*, surrounded by clouds. Then he was taken to
\add God\add*, the one who had been living forever. 
\v 14 He was honored and given great authority to rule over all the nations in the world, in order that people from every
people-group and every nation, people from all language groups, would worship/serve him. He will rule forever; he will never
stop ruling. The kingdom that he rules will never be destroyed. 
\s1 The explanation of the vision 
\p
\v 15 As for me, Daniel, I was very terrified by what I had seen in that vision, and I did not know what to think about it.
\v 16 I went to one of those who were standing in front of the throne of God, and I asked him to tell me what it meant. So he
told me the meaning of it. 
\p
\v 17  \add He said\add*, “The four huge beasts represent four kingdoms/empires that will exist on the earth.
\v 18 But the Supreme God will give power/authority to his people
\add to rule\add*, and they shall rule forever.” 
\p
\v 19 Then I wanted to know what the fourth beast signified—the beast that was different from the other three, the beast that
crushed those that it attacked with its bronze claws, and then ate their flesh with its iron teeth, and trampled on the parts
of their bodies \add that it did not eat\add*. 
\v 20  \add I also wanted to know about\add* the ten horns on its head, and about the horn that appeared later, which got rid
of three of the other horns. \add I wanted to know what it meant
that\add* it had eyes and a mouth with which it spoke very boastfully.
\add The beast that was represented by\add* that horn was more terrifying than the other beasts.
\v 21 While I was having the vision, I saw that this horn attacked God's people and was defeating them.
\v 22 But then the Supreme God, the one who had been living forever, came and judged in favor of the people who belonged to
him. And \add I knew that\add* it was time for God's people to receive authority
\add to rule\add*. 
\p
\v 23 Then the man who was standing there said to me, “The fourth beast represents an empire that will exist on the earth; that
empire will be different from all other empires. \add The army of\add* that empire will crush/kill
\add people all over\add* the world and trample \add on their bodies\add*.
\v 24 As for its ten horns, they represent ten kings who will rule that empire,
\add one after the other\add*. Then another king will appear. He will be different from the previous kings. He will defeat the
three kings \add that were represented by the three horns that were pulled
out\add*. 
\v 25 He will rebuke the Supreme God, and he will oppress God's people. He will try to change the sacred festivals and their
religious laws/regulations. He will control them for three and a half years.
\p
\v 26 But there will be a session/meeting of the court/judges in heaven, and that king's authority/power will be taken away,
and he will be completely destroyed. 
\v 27 Then all the power and the greatness of all the kingdoms on the earth will be given to the people who belong to the
Supreme God. The kingdom that he rules (OR, they rule) will endure forever. And the rulers of all the nations on the earth will
serve and obey him (OR, them).” 
\p
\v 28 That is \add what I saw in\add* my vision/dream. I, Daniel, was terrified, with the result that my face became pale. But
I did not tell anyone about the vision \add that I had seen\add*.\c 8  
\s1 Daniel's vision of a ram and a goat 
\p
\v 1 During the third year that Belshazzar was the king \add of Babylonia\add*, I had another vision
\v 2 In that vision I was in Susa, the capital city of Elam Province. I was standing alongside the Ulai Canal.
\v 3 I looked up and saw a ram that was standing alongside the canal. It had two long horns, but the one that grew last was
longer than the one that grew first. 
\v 4 The ram butted/knocked away \add with its horns\add* everything that was west and everything that was north and everything
that was south of it. There were no other animals that were able to oppose it, and none that could rescue/save other animals
from its power. The ram did whatever it wanted to do and became very powerful.
\p
\v 5 While I thinking \add about what I had seen\add*, I saw a goat come from the west. It ran across the land very quickly,
\add with the result that it seemed that\add* its feet did not touch the ground. This goat had one very large horn between its
eyes. 
\v 6 It was very angry, and it ran straight toward the ram that I had seen previously, the ram that was standing alongside the
canal. 
\v 7 The goat struck the ram furiously and broke off its two horns, with the result that the ram had no power
\add to defend itself\add*. So the goat knocked the ram down and trampled on it. No one could rescue the ram from the goat's
power. 
\v 8 The goat became very powerful. But when its power was very great, its horn was broken off. But four other large horns took
its place. They each pointed in a different direction. 
\p
\v 9 Then from one of those large horns appeared a little horn, which became very big, and pointed toward the south and then
toward the east and then toward the beautiful \add land of Israel\add*.
\v 10  \add The man who was represented by\add* that horn became very strong, with the result that he attacked some of the
\add soldiers of the\add* army of heaven, and (OR, meaning) the stars in the sky
\add which represented God's people\add*. He threw some of them to the ground and trampled on them.
\v 11 He ◄defied/considered himself to be greater than► the leader of the army of heaven, and prevented priests from offering
sacrifices to him. He also ◄defiled the temple/caused the temple to become unholy►.
\v 12 Then God's people allowed the \add man who was represented
by\add* that horn to control/rule them, with the result that they sinned by offering sacrifices to him. And he threw to the
ground the \add laws that contained the\add* true religion. Everything that he did was successful.
\p
\v 13 Then I heard two angels who were talking to each other. One of them asked, “How long will the things/events that were in
this vision continue? How long will the man who rebels against God and causes
\add the temple\add* to be defiled be able to prevent priests from offering sacrifices? How long will he trample on the temple
and on the armies of heaven?” 
\p
\v 14 The other angel replied, “It will continue for 1,150 days. During each of those days,
\add people will not be permitted to offer sacrifices\add* in the morning or in the evening. After that, the temple will be
purified.” 
\s1 Gabriel explained the vision 
\p
\v 15 While I, Daniel, was trying to understand what the vision meant, suddenly
\add an angel\add* who resembled a man stood/appeared in front of me.
\v 16 And I heard a man call out from the \add other side of\add* the Ulai Canal, saying, “Gabriel, explain to him the meaning
of the vision that he saw!” 
\p
\v 17 So Gabriel came and stood beside me. I was very terrified, with the result that I fell onto the ground. But he said to
me, “Man, it is necessary for you to understand that \add the events that you saw
in\add* the vision will occur \add near\add* the time that \add the
world\add* will end.” 
\p
\v 18 While he was speaking, I fainted. I lay there, unconscious, with my face still on the ground. But Gabriel put his hand on
me and lifted me up in order that I could stand again. 
\p
\v 19 Then he said, “I \add have come here to\add* tell you what will happen because of
\add God\add* being angry. These things will happen near the time when
\add the world\add* will end. 
\v 20 As for the ram with two horns that you saw, those horns \add represent\add* the kingdoms of Media and Persia.
\v 21 The goat \add that you saw represents\add* the kingdom of Greece, and the horn that appeared between its eyes
\add represents\add* its first king. 
\v 22 As for the four horns that grew after the first horn was broken off, they
\add represent\add* four kingdoms into which that first kingdom will be divided
\add after the first king dies\add*. Those four kingdoms will not be as strong/powerful as the first kingdom was.
\p
\v 23 The people in those kingdoms will become very wicked, with the result that it will be necessary for them to be punished.
But near the time when those kingdoms will end, one of those kingdoms will have a king who will be very proud/defiant [IDI]. He
will also be very fierce and very deceitful. 
\v 24 He will become very powerful, but it will not be because of what he himself does. He will terribly destroy things in many
places, and he will succeed in doing everything that he wants to. He will get rid of many powerful men, and also some of God's
people. 
\v 25 Because he is very cunning/clever, he will succeed by doing things that deceive many people. He will be proud of himself.
He will get rid of many people when they think that they are safe. He will also rebel against
\add God\add* [EUP], who is the greatest king. But \add God\add* will destroy him, without the help [MTY] of any human being.
\p
\v 26 What you saw in the vision about \add priests being prevented from
making\add* sacrifices in the morning and in the evening, which I explained to you, will surely happen. But
\add for the present time\add*, do not reveal the vision \add to
others\add*, because it will be many years before those things happen.”
\p
\v 27 Then I, Daniel, became weak, and I was sick for several days. Then I arose and returned to doing the work that the king
had given to me, but I was perplexed/confused about the vision, and I could not understand it.\c 9  
\s1 Daniel's prayer 
\p
\v 1  \add Now I am going to tell you about what happened\add* when Darius, who was from the Mede people-group and who was the
son of Xerxes, ruled as the king of Babylonia. 
\v 2 During the first year that he was the king, I, Daniel, was studying/reading in the holy books/Scriptures the message that
Yahweh had given to the prophet Jeremiah. In that message Jeremiah had written that Jerusalem would
\add be destroyed and\add* remain ruined for seventy years. 
\v 3  \add After I read that\add*, I pleaded to Yahweh my God \add to help
us\add*, praying and ◄fasting/abstaining from eating food►. \add While doing that, I was
wearing\add* rough cloth and sitting in ashes \add to show that I was very sad about what had happened to
us\add*. 
\p
\v 4 I confessed the sins that we had committed, and this is what I prayed:
\b
\pi1 Lord, you are great and awesome! You have faithfully done what you said that you would do for us. You faithfully love
those who love you and who do what you have commanded \add that they should
do\add*. 
\v 5 But we \add Israelis\add* have sinned. We have done things that are wrong. We have done wicked things, and we have
rebelled against you. We have turned away from \add obeying\add* your commands [DOU].
\v 6 Your prophets spoke for you [MTY], \add giving your messages
to\add* our kings, to our other rulers, to our other ancestors, and to all the Israeli people, but we have refsed to ◄pay
attention to/heed► those prophets. 
\pi1
\v 7 Lord, you always do what is righteous/just/fair, but we have caused ourselves to be ashamed [IDI]. This is still true
about all of the Israelis who live in Jerusalem and who live in other places in Judea. It is also true about all us Israelis
whom you scattered, who \add were taken to\add* other countries, some near
\add Israel\add* and some far away, because we were very unfaithful/disloyal to you.
\v 8 Lord, we and our kings and our other rulers and our other ancestors have done very shameful things and have sinned against
you. 
\v 9 Although we have rebelled against you, you act mercifully toward us and you
\add are willing/ready\add* to forgive us. 
\v 10 Yahweh our God, when you gave your laws to your prophets who served you, and they told us to conduct our lives according
to those laws, we did not ◄listen to/heed► you. 
\v 11 All of us Israeli people have disobeyed your laws, and we have turned away from
\add obeying\add* what you said. We have sinned against you. As a result, you have caused us to experience the terrible things
that your servant Moses said/wrote \add would happen to us\add* if we sinned against you.
\pi1
\v 12 You warned us and our rulers that you would punish Jerusalem severely by causing a great disaster there, a disaster that
would be worse than any disaster that any other city had ever experienced, and you have done what you said that you would do.
\v 13 You punished us just like Moses wrote that you would do. But Yahweh our God, we still have not tried, by turning away
from our sinning and by heeding your truth, to persuade you to act mercifully toward us.
\v 14 So, because we did not obey you, you prepared to punish us, and then you did punish us, because you always do what is
righteous/just/fair. 
\pi1
\v 15 Lord our God, you brought your people out of Egypt by your great power [MTY], and by doing that you have caused people
from that time until the present time to know that you are great [IDI]
\add even though\add* we have sinned and done wicked things. 
\v 16 Lord, Jerusalem is your city, and \add your temple was built
there\add* on your sacred hill. Now all the people who live in nearby countries/nations despise Jerusalem and us your people
because of our sins and because of the evil things that our ancestors did. But now, because you do what is righteous/just,
\add we request you to\add* not be angry with Jerusalem any longer.
\pi1
\v 17 Lord our God, listen to what I am praying and pleading for you to do. ◄For your own sake/In order that people will know
that you are very great►, act kindly [IDI] concerning your temple, which was destroyed
\add by the armies of Babylonia\add*. 
\v 18 My God, listen to \add my prayer\add*. Look at us and see our troubles, and see that this city that belongs to you [MTY]
is ruined/destroyed. We are praying to you because you are merciful, not because we have done what is right/good.
\v 19 Lord, listen to us! Lord, forgive us! Lord, this city and these people belong to you, so
\add we plead with you to\add* heed what we are saying and act \add to help
us\add* right now, ◄for your own sake/in order that people will know that you are very great►!
\s1 Gabriel told what would happen in the future 
\p
\v 20 I continued praying and confessing the sins that I and my people had committed, and pleading with Yahweh my God that he
would restore \add the temple on\add* the sacred hill \add in Jerusalem\add*.
\v 21 While I was praying, Gabriel, the angel/one whom I had seen in the vision previously, came flying rapidly to me, at the
time in the evening when the priests offered sacrifices. 
\v 22 He said to me, “Daniel, I have come to you to enable you to understand [DOU] clearly
\add the message that God gave to Jeremiah\add*. 
\v 23 When you began to plead with God, he gave me a message \add to give to
you\add*. He loves you very much, so \add he has sent me\add* to tell you what he said to me. So now ◄pay attention/listen
carefully► in order that you may understand the meaning of what he revealed
\add to Jeremiah\add*. 
\p
\v 24 God has determined/declared that there will be 490 years until he frees/saves your people from
\add the guilt of\add* their sins and to atone for the evil things that they have done. Then God will rule everyone justly, and
he will do that forever. And what you saw in the vision and what
\add Jeremiah\add* prophesied will ◄come true/be fulfilled►, and the sacred temple will be dedicated
\add to God again\add*. 
\p
\v 25 You need to know and understand this: There will be 49 years from the time that
\add the king\add* commands that Jerusalem should be rebuilt until the leader/king that God has chosen will come. Then 434
years later, Jerusalem will be rebuilt, and it will have streets and will have a ◄moat/deep ditch filled with water► around it
\add to protect the city\add*. But that will be a time when \add God's
people\add* have a lot of troubles/difficulties/suffering. 
\v 26 After those 434 years, the leader/king whom God has appointed will be killed ◄unjustly/without having done anything
wrong►. After that, the temple will be destroyed by \add the army
of\add* a powerful ruler. The city and the temple will be destroyed like a flood [MET]
\add destroys everything\add*. That will be the beginning of the war and destruction that
\add God\add* has decreed will happen. 
\v 27 That ruler will make a strong agreement with many people. He will promise to do what he has said in that agreement for
seven years. But when that time is half finished, he will prevent priests from giving any more offerings and sacrifices to God.
A disgusting idol will be put on the highest part of the temple, and it will stay there until
\add God\add* gets rid of the one who put it there, which is what he said that he would do.”\c 10  
\s1 Daniel's vision at the Tigris River 
\p
\v 1 During the third year that Cyrus was the king of Persia, I Daniel,
\add who had been given the\add* name Belteshazzar, received \add another\add* message
\add from God\add*. The message was true, but it was very difficult for me to understand it. But
\add later\add* I understood the message because of the vision that I had seen.
\p
\v 2 At that time I had been sad for three weeks \add about what had happened to
Jerusalem\add*. 
\v 3 I did not eat any tasty food or any meat or drink any wine. I did not even put any perfumed oil on
\add my face or hair\add* for those three weeks. 
\p
\v 4  \add When those three weeks ended\add*, on April 23, \add my companions
and\add* I were standing on the bank of the great Tigris River. 
\v 5 I looked up and saw someone there who was wearing fine white/linen clothes and a belt
\add made of\add* pure gold. 
\v 6 His body \add shone\add* like a precious beryl stone. His face was
\add as bright as\add* a flash of lightning. His eyes were/shone like flaming torches. His arms and legs
\add shone\add* like polished bronze. And his voice was \add very
loud\add*, like the roar of a huge crowd. 
\p
\v 7 I, Daniel, was the only one who saw this vision. The men who were with me did not see anything, but
\add they sensed that someone was there, and they\add* became terrified. They ran away and hid themselves.
\v 8 So I was left there by myself, looking at this very unusual vision. I had no strength left. My face became very pale, with
the result that no one would have recognized me. 
\v 9 I saw a man there, and when I heard him speak, I fell to the ground. I ◄fainted/became unconscious►,
\add and I lay there\add* with my face on the ground. 
\p
\v 10 Suddenly someone's hand took hold of me and lifted me, with the result that I was on my hands and knees,
\add but I was still\add* trembling. 
\v 11 The man said to me, “Daniel, God loves you very much. Stand up and listen to what I am going to say to you, because
\add God\add* sent me to you.” When he said that, I stood up, but I was still trembling.
\p
\v 12 Then he said to me, “Daniel, do not be afraid. God has heard what you have prayed ever since the first day that you
determined to humble yourself in order to understand \add the vision\add*. I have come to you because of what you prayed.
\v 13 The \add evil spirit who\add* rules the kingdom of Persia resisted/hindered me for 21 days, but Michael, who is one of
God's chief angels, came to help me. I left him there in Persia \add to
resist\add* that evil spirit who rules there. 
\v 14 I have come here to enable you to understand what will happen to the Israeli people in the future.
\add Do not forget that\add* the vision \add that you saw\add* is about
\add things that will happen in\add* the future, \add not about things that will happen very
soon\add*.” 
\p
\v 15 While he was saying that, I stared at the ground and was unable to say anything
\add because I was very afraid\add*. 
\v 16 Suddenly \add the angel\add*, who resembled a human, touched my lips. Then
\add I was able to speak, and\add* I said to him, “Sir, because \add I have
seen\add* this vision, I have become very weak, with the result that I cannot stop trembling.
\v 17 I am not able [RHQ] to talk to you, my master. I have no strength left, and it is very difficult for me to breathe.”
\p
\v 18 But he took hold of me again, and enabled me to become stronger again.
\v 19 He said to me, “Man, God loves you very much. So do not be afraid. I desire/want that things will go well for you and
that you will be encouraged.” When he had said that, I felt even stronger, and I said, “Sir, tell me what you want to tell me.
You have enabled me to feel stronger.” 
\p
\v 20-21 Then he said, “◄Do you know why I came to you?/I will tell you why I came to you.► [RHQ] It is to reveal to you what
is written in the book which reveals/contains God's truth. But now I must return to fight against the evil spirit who rules the
kingdom of Persia. After I have defeated him, the evil angel who guards Greece will appear
\add and I must defeat him\add*. Michael, who guards you \add Israeli
people\add*, will help me, but there is no one else to help me.”\c 11  
\nb
\v 1 “As for me, during the first year that Darius was king, I helped and encouraged Michael.”
\s1 The message about the kings of Egypt and Syria 
\p
\v 2  \add The angel also said\add*, “And what I am going to reveal to you now will truly
\add happen\add*. There will be three more kings to rule Persia,
\add one after the other\add*. Then there will be a fourth king, who will be much richer than the others. As a result of
\add his giving\add* a lot of money \add to people, they will enable him
to\add* become very powerful. Then he will incite/persuade many nations [HYP]
\add to fight\add* against the kingdom of Greece. 
\p
\v 3 Then a very powerful king will appear \add in Greece\add*. He will rule over a very large empire, and he will do whatever
he wants to do. 
\v 4 But when he has become very powerful, \add he will die\add*. Then his kingdom will be divided into four parts. Kings who
are not his descendants will rule, but they will not be as powerful as he was.
\v 5 Then the king of Egypt [MTY] will become very powerful. But one of his army generals will become more powerful than he is,
and he will rule a bigger area. 
\v 6 Several years later, the king of Egypt and the king of Syria will make an ◄alliance/agreement to help each other► [MTY].
The king of Syria will give his daughter to the king of Egypt to become his wife. But she will not be able to influence him
[MTY] very long, and that woman, her husband, her child, and her servants will all be killed/assassinated.
\p
\v 7 Soon after that, one of her relatives [MET] will become king
\add of Egypt\add*. His army will attack the army of Syria. They will enter the fortress of the soldiers of Syria and defeat
them. 
\v 8 They will return to Egypt, taking the statues of the gods \add of the people of
Syria\add* and many items made of silver and gold that had been dedicated to those gods. Then for several years his army will
not attack \add the army of\add* the king of Syria. 
\v 9 Then the army of the king of Syria will invade Egypt, but they will soon return to Syria.
\v 10 However, the sons of the king of Syria will prepare to start a war, and they will gather a large army. That army will
march \add south\add* and spread all over \add Israel\add* like a huge flood. They will attack a strong fortress
\add in the south of Israel\add*. 
\p
\v 11 Then the king of Egypt, having become very angry, will march
\add with his army\add* \add north\add* from Egypt and fight against the army of Syria. The king
\add of Syria\add* will gather together a very large army, but \add the army of the king of
Egypt\add* will defeat them. 
\v 12 The king of Egypt will become very proud because of \add his
army\add* having killed a very large number of soldiers \add from
Syria\add*, but his army will not continue to win battles. 
\v 13 The king of Syria will again gather together an army that will be bigger than the one that he had before. After a few
years, he will again march \add south on their way to Egypt\add* with a large army and a lot of equipment
\add for fighting battles\add*. 
\p
\v 14 At that time, many people in Egypt will rebel against their king. In order to fulfill a vision that
\add one of their leaders had seen\add*, some violent/lawless people from your country
\add of Israel\add* will also rebel \add in order to not be controlled by Egypt
anymore\add*, but they will be defeated. 
\v 15 Then the king of Syria will come \add south with his army\add* and pile up dirt against the walls of a city that is well
protected, and they will \add break through those walls and\add* they will capture the city. The soldiers from Egypt
\add who have come to defend that city\add*, even the best troops, will not be strong enough to continue to fight.
\v 16 So the king of Syria will do whatever he wants to, and no one will be able to oppose him.
\add His army\add* will occupy the glorious land \add of Israel\add* and completely control/subdue it.
\v 17 Then he will decide to march \add south\add* with all the soldiers from his kingdom. He will make an alliance with the
king \add of Egypt\add* and in order that his daughter will \add help him
to\add* destroy the kingdom of Egypt, he will give her to the king of Egypt to become his wife. But that plan will fail.
\v 18 After that, the \add army of\add* the king of Syria will attack the regions that are close to the
\add Mediterranean\add* Sea, and his \add army\add* will conquer many of them. But
\add the army of\add* a leader from another country will defeat the army of Syria and will stop their king from continuing to
be proud. He will do to the king of Syria what he deserved for being very insolent.
\v 19 Then the king of Syria will return to the fortresses in his own land. But he will be defeated, and he will ◄die/be
assassinated► [EUP] there. 
\p
\v 20 Then another man will ◄succeed him/become king►. That king will send one of his officers to oppress the people
\add in Jerusalem\add* by forcing them to pay big taxes, in order to get more money for his kingdom. But after a few years
[HYP] that king will die, but he will not die as a result of people being angry with him or in a battle.
\p
\v 21 The next king of Syria will be an evil man who, \add because he will not be the son of the previous
king\add*, will not have the right to become king. But he will come when people do not expect it, and he will become king by
tricking the people. 
\v 22 When his army advances, they will attack any armies that oppose him and destroy those armies. They will also kill God's
Supreme Priest. 
\v 23 By making treaties/alliances with \add the rulers of\add* other nations, he will deceive them, and he will become very
powerful, even though he rules a nation that does not have a lot of people.
\v 24 Suddenly his \add army\add* will invade a province that is very wealthy, and they will do things that none of his
ancestors did: They will capture in battles all kinds of possessions from the people whom they defeat. Then the king will
divide those possessions among his friends. He will also plan \add for his
army\add* to attack fortresses \add in Egypt\add*, but only for a short time.
\p
\v 25 He will courageously/boldly conscript/gather a large and powerful army to attack
\add the army of\add* the king of Egypt. But the king of Egypt will prepare to fight against them with a huge and powerful
army. However, someone will deceive him, with the result that his plan will not be successful.
\v 26 Even his most trusted advisors will plan to get rid of him. His army will be defeated and many of his soldiers will be
killed. 
\v 27 Then the two \add kings who both want to rule that area\add* will sit down at the same table and eat together, but they
will both lie to each other. Neither of them will get what he wants, because it will not be the time
\add that God\add* has determined/set \add for them to rule\add*.
\v 28  \add The army of\add* the king \add of Syria\add* will return to Syria, taking with them all the valuable things
\add that they have captured\add*. The king will be determined to get rid of the Supreme Priest of the Jewish people. He will
do what he wants to \add in Israel\add*, and then return to his own country.
\p
\v 29 When it is the time that God has decided, the king of Syria
\add and his army\add* will invade Egypt again. But this time he will not be successful like he was before.
\v 30 The army of Rome will come in ships and oppose his army and cause him to be afraid. So he will be very angry, and
\add with his army\add* he will return \add to Israel\add* and try to get rid of the Supreme Priest. The king of Syria will do
what those who have abandoned the Jewish religion advise/want him to do for them.
\v 31 Some of his soldiers will do things to ◄defile the temple/cause the temple to become unholy for them►. They will prevent
the priests from offering sacrifices each day, and they will put
\add in the temple\add* something that is disgusting/abominable.
\p
\v 32 By deceiving those who have abandoned the Jewish religion, he will win them to ◄become his supporters/help him to do what
he wants to do►. But those who are devoted to their God will firmly oppose them.
\v 33 And wise \add Israeli\add* leaders will teach others also. But for a while, some of those wise leaders will be killed in
battles, and some will be burned to death, and some will be robbed, and some will be put in prison.
\p
\v 34 While God's people are being persecuted, some people will help them a little bit, although some of those who help them
will not do it sincerely. 
\v 35 Some of those wise leaders will be killed [EUP], but as a result the others will be purified [DOU]. This suffering will
continue until it is the time \add that God\add* has appointed \add for it
to\add* end. 
\s1 The king of Syria who praises himself 
\p
\v 36 The king \add of Syria\add* will do what he wants to. He will boast and say that he is greater than any god. He will even
revile the Supreme God. He will be able to do what he wants until the time that
\add God\add* punishes [MTY] him. \add God\add* will accomplish what he has planned.
\v 37 The \add king of Syria\add* will ignore the god that his ancestors worshiped and the god that many women love. He will
ignore every god, because he will think that he is greater than all of them.
\v 38 But he will honor the god who \add people think\add* protects fortresses. That is a god whom his ancestors did not honor.
And he will give gold, silver, ◄jewels/very valuable stones► and other expensive gifts to that god.
\v 39 He will ask that god (OR, people who worship a god) from another country to help him to defend his fortresses. He will
greatly honor those who allow him \add to be their ruler\add*. He will appoint
\add some of\add* them to important positions in the government; and to reward them, he will give them some land.
\p
\v 40 But when his time \add to rule\add* is almost ended, \add the army
of\add* the king of Egypt will attack his \add army\add*. The \add army of
the\add* king of Syria will fight against them furiously [SIM]. \add His soldiers will be
driving\add* chariots and \add riding on\add* horses and \add traveling
in\add* many ships. His army will invade many countries and \add spread all over those
countries\add* like a flood [MET]. 
\v 41 They will invade the glorious land \add of Israel\add* and kill [EUP] tens of thousands of people. But the people of the
Edom people-group and the people of the Moab people-group and the people of the Ammon people-group who are still alive will
escape. 
\v 42 When the army of Syria invades other countries, even the people of Egypt will be defeated.
\v 43 The army of Syria will take away from Egypt gold, silver, and other valuable items. The people of Libya and Ethiopia will
allow \add the king of Syria\add* to rule over them. 
\v 44 But he will become very frightened/alarmed when he hears reports about what is happening in the east and in the north. So
he will become very angry, and send his army to fight furiously and kill many
\add of their enemies\add*. 
\v 45 The \add king of Syria\add* will set up his royal tents in the area between the
\add Mediterranean\add* Sea and the hill \add in Jerusalem\add* on which the temple ◄exists/was built►. But he will be killed
there, because there will be no one to help him.” \c 12  
\s1 When this world will end 
\p
\v 1  \add The angel also said to me\add*, “After those things happen, the great angel Michael, who protects the
\add Israeli\add* people, will appear. Then there will be a time when there will be great troubles/suffering. The troubles will
be greater than any troubles/suffering since the nations began. At that time, all of your people whose names have been written
in the book \add containing the names of those who have eternal life\add* will be saved.
\v 2 Many of those who have died [EUP] will become alive again. Some of them will live eternally
\add with God\add*, and some will be eternally shamed/disgraced \add in
hell\add*. 
\v 3 Those who were wise will shine as brightly as the sky \add is bright when the sun is
shining\add*. And those who have shown to others the way to live righteously will shine forever, like the stars [SIM].
\v 4 But as for you, Daniel, close up the scroll/book \add in which you are
writing\add*, and seal it \add in order that no one can open it\add* until the end
\add of the world\add* is near. \add Before that happens\add*, many people will travel rapidly here and there, leaning more and
more \add about many things\add*.” 
\p
\v 5 When \add that angel finished speaking\add*, I, Daniel, looked up, and suddenly I saw two other
\add angels\add*. One was standing on the side of the river \add where I
was\add*, and one was standing on the other side. 
\v 6 One of them \add called to\add* the other one, who was wearing linen/white clothes, who was now standing further up (OR,
above) the river, “How long will it be until these amazing/frightening events end?”
\p
\v 7 The angel who was on the other side of (OR, above) the river raised his hands toward the sky, and solemnly promised, with
the authority [MTY] of God, who lives forever, “It will be three and a half years. All these things will end after God's people
stop fighting against those who ◄persecute/cause trouble for/cause suffering for► them.”
\p
\v 8 I heard \add what he said\add*, but I did not understand it. So I asked, “Sir, what will be the result when these things
end?” 
\p
\v 9 He replied, “Daniel, you must leave now. \add I cannot answer your
question\add* because what it means must ◄be kept secret/not be revealed► [DOU] until the time when everything ends.
\v 10 Many people will thoroughly purify their inner beings [DOU]. But wicked people will not understand these things. They
will continue to be wicked. Only those who are wise will understand
\add these things\add*. 
\v 11  \add But I can tell you that before everything ends\add*, there will be 1,290 days, from the time that people are
prevented from offering sacrifices each day, that is, from the time that the abominable/disgusting thing is put in the temple.
\v 12 God will be pleased with those who remain faithful until 1,335 days are ended.
\p
\v 13 So \add now I say\add* to you, continue to faithfully \add trust
God\add* until \add your life on earth\add* ends. You will die [EUP], but when everything ends, you will receive your reward
\add from God\add*.”
